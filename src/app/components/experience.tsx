            Since October of my Sophomore year, I have been working on Soul.
            Soul is a digital identity authenticator built on Solana, and we are
            a small startup based in Los Angeles. At Soul, I have been deeply
            involved in creating innovative blockchain-based identity solutions.
            Our team has won over $60,000 in hackathons for our work with
            Soulstamps and AquaID, which combined into Soul. I am a Software
            Engineer on the team and am currently developing a RESTful backend
            system for controlling autonomous lead finding and direct email
            marketing.

            Starting this May, I have been a Software Engineer intern at
            Honeywell in their Atlanta offices. I am working under Honeywell
            Connected Enterprises (HCE) with Logistics and Warehouse team,
            developing applications and APIs for the Operational Intelligence
            team.

            Last Summer I was a Creative Studio intern at Major League Baseball.
            During my time at MLB, I put my coding skills to use by creating a
            web application that made the process of reviewing live game tweets
            from MLB accounts a breeze. With a combination of React.js for
            frontend development, Python for backend tasks, and deftly written
            calls to RESTful and Twitter APIs, I managed to boost our tracking
            efficiency significantly by over 80%. My role also saw me keeping a
            close eye on the performance of a massive number of social media
            posts - over 3,500 to be exact - spanning Instagram, Facebook, and
            Twitter for both domestic and international MLB accounts.
