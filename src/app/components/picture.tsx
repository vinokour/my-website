        I am currently pursuing a junior at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business.

New technologies have always intrigued me, not just for their innovative aspects but more importantly, for their potential to reshape our world. I keep a keen eye on emerging trends and advancements, and I am always eager to learn more about the latest developments in the tech industry.

Being a sports enthusiast, I am particularly interested in sports analytics. The way data-driven insights are changing the game fascinates me, and I'm always up for discussing the latest trends and innovations in this field. And yes, nothing beats the thrill of watching Ohio State lose to Michigan in any aspect of life.

As far as the entertainment industry is concerned, I am intrigued by the transformative potential of technology. From revolutionizing content creation and distribution to reshaping audience engagement, I believe there are still many untapped opportunities to be explored.

Currently, I am actively seeking SWE/AI Summer internships for 2024, eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. 

Outside of academics and career pursuits, I am dedicated to developing products for Soul, a digital identity verification platform. Working on this project has allowed me to apply my technical skills in a practical setting, enhancing my understanding of blockchain technology and its applications in the realm of identity verification.

I welcome any opportunity to connect and discuss my interests or potential collaborations. I look forward to hearing from you!
